The SIGCSE2020 website.

# Getting Started

First, you will want to check out the site.

Then, in the source directory, you will want to run the following command:

bundle install --path _vendor/bundle

This installs a number of things that are needed by Jekyll to build the site. This should "just work" in Linux-like environments.
